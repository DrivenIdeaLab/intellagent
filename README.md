Most conversational AI agents fail in production due to hallucinations, inconsistent responses, and policy violations - all stemming from small, manually curated test datasets. Without comprehensive testing, critical weaknesses remain hidden until they impact real users.

**This is where IntellAgent steps in.** IntellAgent's multi-agent framework helps you test your agent from every angle, uncover its weaknesses, and provide actionable insights for optimization and confident deployment.

### Key Features
- üî¨ **Edge-Case Generation**  
 Automatically create thousands of realistic test scenarios tailored to your agent's use cases and requirements

- ü§ñ **User Interaction Simulation**  
 Test your agent against diverse user behaviors and conversation patterns across varying complexity levels

- üìä **Performance Analytics**  
 Get detailed metrics and insights to identify weaknesses, track improvements, and optimize your agent's performance

- üí™ **Production-Ready Deployment**  
 Deploy with confidence knowing your agent has been thoroughly tested against real-world scenarios

Stop hoping your agent will work in production. Know it will. Start building robust conversational agents that your users can trust.


> To understand the key concepts and how the IntellAgent system operates, refer to the [system overview guide](https://intellagent-doc.plurai.ai/How_it_Works/how-it-works/)

## :fire: Quickstart

> For a more detailed and comprehensive guide, see the [Start Guide](https://intellagent-doc.plurai.ai/quick_start/installation/).









IntellAgent requires `python >= 3.9`
<br />

#### Step 1 - Download and install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:plurai-ai/intellagent.git
cd intellagent
```

You can use Conda or pip to install the dependencies.

Using pip: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


#### Step 2 - Set your LLM API Key

Edit the `config/llm_env.yml` file to set up your LLM configuration (OpenAI/Azure/Vertex/Anthropic):

```yaml
openai:
  OPENAI_API_KEY: "your-api-key-here"
```

To change the default LLM provider or model for either the IntellAgent system or the chat-agent, you can easily update the configuration file. For instance, modify the `config/config_education.yml` file:


```yaml
llm_intellagent:
    type: 'azure'

llm_chat:
    type: 'azure'
```

To change the number of samples in the database you should modify the `num_samples` in the config file:
```yaml
dataset:
    num_samples: 30
```


####  Step 3 - Run the Simulator
If you're utilizing Azure OpenAI services for the `llm_intellagent`, ensure you [disable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/content-filters) the default `jailbreak` filter before running the simulator.

For fast simple environment without a database, run the following command:
```bash
python run.py --output_path results/education --config_path ./config/config_education.yml 
```
For more complex (slower) environment with a database, run the following command:
```bash
python run.py --output_path results/airline --config_path ./config/config_airline.yml 
```

> **Troubleshooting**  
> - **Rate limit messages** ‚Üí Decrease `num_workers` variables in the `config_default` file.  
> - **Frequent timeout errors** ‚Üí Increase the `timeout` values in the `config_default` file.


Explore the [Customization](https://intellagent-doc.plurai.ai/customization/custom_environment/) options to configure the simulation for your environment, or delve into the [examples](https://intellagent-doc.plurai.ai/examples/education/) we provide to learn more about its capabilities.
#### Step 4 - See the Results

To visualize the simulation results using streamlit, run:
```bash 
streamlit run simulator/visualization/Simulator_Visualizer.py
```
This will launch a[ Streamlit dashboard](./README.md#-demo) showing detailed analytics and visualizations of your simulation results.

**IntellAgent** is a powerful multi-agent framework designed to deliver automated diagnostics for AI agents. It simulates thousands of edge-case scenarios to test your agent from every angle, uncover weaknesses, and provide actionable insights for optimization.

Don't let unknowns hold your agent back. With IntellAgent, you can understand its limits, address gaps, and deploy confidently.

## Key Features

- üî¨ **Generate Thousands of Edge-Case Scenarios:**  
  Automatically generate highly realistic edge-case scenarios tailored specifically to your agent.

- ü§ñ **Simulate Diverse User Interactions:**  
  Evaluate your agent across a wide spectrum of scenarios with varying complexity levels.

- üìä **Comprehensive Performance Evaluations:**  
  Gain detailed metrics to uncover performance gaps, identify areas for improvement, and make informed decisions to optimize your models.

- üí™ **Confident Deployment of Robust Agents:**  
  Deploy agents that are reliable, resilient, and ready for real-world interactions.



> To understand the key concepts and how the IntellAgent system operates, refer to the [system overview guide](https://intellagent-doc.plurai.ai/How_it_Works/how-it-works/)

## :fire: Quickstart

> For a more detailed and comprehensive guide, see the [Start Guide](https://intellagent-doc.plurai.ai/quick_start/installation/).









IntellAgent requires `python >= 3.9`
<br />

#### Step 1 - Download and install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:plurai-ai/intellagent.git
cd intellagent
```

You can use Conda or pip to install the dependencies.

Using pip: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


#### Step 2 - Set your LLM API Key

Edit the `config/llm_env.yml` file to set up your LLM configuration (OpenAI/Azure/Vertex/Anthropic):

```yaml
openai:
  OPENAI_API_KEY: "your-api-key-here"
```

To change the default LLM provider or model for either the IntellAgent system or the chatbot, you can easily update the configuration file. For instance, modify the `config/config_education.yml` file:


```yaml
llm_intellagent:
    type: 'azure'

llm_chat:
    type: 'azure'
```

To change the number of samples in the database you should modify the `num_samples` in the config file:
```yaml
dataset:
    num_samples: 30
```


####  Step 3 - Run the Simulator
If you're utilizing Azure OpenAI services for the `llm_intellagent`, ensure you [disable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/content-filters) the default `jailbreak` filter before running the simulator.

For fast simple environment without a database, run the following command:
```bash
python run.py --output_path results/education --config_path ./config/config_education.yml 
```
For more complex (slower) environment with a database, run the following command:
```bash
python run.py --output_path results/airline --config_path ./config/config_airline.yml 
```

> **Troubleshooting**  
> - **rate limit messages** ‚Üí Decrease `num_workers` variables in the `config_default` file.  
> - **Frequent timeout errors** ‚Üí Increase the `timeout` values in the `config_default` file.


Explore the [Customization](https://intellagent-doc.plurai.ai/customization/custom_environment/) options to configure the simulation for your environment, or delve into the [examples](https://intellagent-doc.plurai.ai/examples/education/) we provide to learn more about its capabilities.
#### Step 4 - See the Results

To visualize the simulation results using streamlit, run:
```bash 
streamlit run simulator/visualization/Simulator_Visualizer.py
```
This will launch a[ Streamlit dashboard](./README.md#-demo) showing detailed analytics and visualizations of your simulation results.
